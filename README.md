A "getting to know you" guessing game. It should take your name to provide a personalized experience, then ask 3 yes/no questions and one question regarding numbers.

1/6: Separated concerns, moved javascript into app.js file.

1/6 Changed first question to a prompt to show off a string method.

1/6 Added answersRight counter.

1/6 Added while loop to final question so it goes until you get it right. Added final message with both answersRight and timesTried counters.
